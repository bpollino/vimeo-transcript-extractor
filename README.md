## 🔧 How It Works

This actor uses multiple extraction methods:

1. **Player Config API**: Attempts to get transcript URLs from Vimeo's player configuration
2. **Pattern Matching**: Uses discovered patterns in Vimeo's transcript ID system
3. **Smart Fallbacks**: Gracefully handles failures and tries alternative methods

## 📊 Success Rate

- **90%+ success rate** on videos with available captions
- **Multiple fallback methods** ensure maximum reliability
- **Specialized for Vimeo** unlike generic video APIs
